# Web 3bune Protocol (Web Threebune Protocol) Documentation

## TL;DR

- Web 3bune is a neutral protocol to create and distribute token gated news articles
- The goal is to align incentives between publishers and aggregators
- The MVP is published at https://web3bune.deeecent.website/
- We have a first integration with the aggregator Kiwi News https://news.kiwistand.com/

## Problem

There is a significant **incentive misalignment** between the interests of publishers and aggregators. Both parties want to retain users within their respective platformsâ€”publishers want users to stay on their sites to maximize engagement and potential ad revenue, while aggregators want to keep users on their own platforms to increase their traffic and influence. Moreover, the **ad-driven content economy** needs to maximize impressions and retain users: content often becomes clickbait-driven, leading to a decline in the quality and credibility of information.

## Solution

1. **Decentralized Content Protocol**: Web3bune Protocol aims to realign incentives by providing a decentralized platform where both content creators and aggregators can benefit without the need to retain users on their respective platforms.

2. **Token-Gated Content**: Writers and publishers can tokenize their content, making it accessible only to those who pay for it. This allows them to monetize their work directly without relying on user retention or ad impressions.

3. **Aggregator Rewards**: Aggregators are incentivized to distribute content by earning a predefined fee whenever they share a link to a paywalled article. This aligns their interests with those of the writers/publishers, as they benefit from the sale of content rather than simply keeping users on their own platform.

4. **Microtransactions and Resellable Content**: The protocol enables low-cost microtransactions for content access, making it affordable for users while providing revenue for creators. Since the content is in the form of NFTs, it can also be resold, allowing readers to recoup some of their costs and adding value to the purchase.

## Case Study: Integration with Kiwi News and FarCaster Frame

In this case study:

- a post is produced via https://web3bune.deeecent.website/
- the post is indexed by the aggregation platform Kiwi News
- the minting function allows the aggregator to specifty where the aggregator fee is collected
- once the token is minted, the content is readable

An example of the Web3bune Protocol in action can be seen in its integration with Kiwi News. This case study illustrates how the protocol helps Kiwi News balance the tension between content creators and aggregators by providing a fair revenue distribution model.
